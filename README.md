# TERO - Trusted Execution Runtime Orchestrator

TERO is a comprehensive platform for secure, distributed computing with Zero Trust Architecture principles. It provides a secure runtime environment for containerized applications with strong isolation, attestation, and policy enforcement.

## Overview

TERO is designed to provide the following features:

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: All components are authenticated, authorized, and encrypted by default.
- **Secure Containers**: Isolated execution environments with hardware-backed security guarantees.
- **Quantum-Network Fabric Layer**: A secure networking layer for container-to-container communication.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Fine-grained policies for access control and data protection.
- **Attestation**: Cryptographic verification of system integrity and identity.
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom security and management features.

## Components

### Runtime

The Runtime module provides the core execution environment for containers. It manages the lifecycle of containers, enforces security policies, and provides isolation guarantees.

### Network Manager

The Network Manager (Quantum-Network Fabric Layer) provides secure networking for containers. It implements the Container Networking Interface (CNI) specification and provides virtual networks with Zero Trust security features.

### Plugin Manager

The Plugin Manager enables extensibility through a plugin system. It allows for custom security features, policy engines, and management interfaces to be added to the platform.

### Common

The Common module provides shared functionality used by all components, including error handling, logging, and utility functions.

## Architecture

TERO follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

|                                                                    |
|        Error Handling, Logging, Utilities, Shared Types            |

## Getting Started

### Building

To build all components of TERO, run the following commands:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will build all the binaries and libraries in the project.

### Running

To run the Network Manager API server:

```bash
./target/release/quantum-api
```

To install the CNI plugin:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
cp ./target/release/quantum-cni /opt/cni/bin/
```

### Configuration

TERO can be configured using environment variables or configuration files. See the documentation for each component for more details.

## Development

### Running Tests

To run the tests for all components:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Code Structure

- `common/`: Shared functionality used by all components
- `network-manager/`: Quantum-Network Fabric Layer for container networking
