Absolutely! Rebuilding **ForgeOne** module-by-module under your supervision is a **smart and scalable** approach â€” especially for something as large as a **modular, containerization platform** with WebAssembly, Zero Trust, and microkernel architecture.

## ðŸ”§ ForgeOne â€” From Scratch, Module-Wise Guide

### ðŸ”¥ High-Level Strategy

We'll split development into clean **modules** (crates), ensuring each is:

* Independently buildable
* Testable
* Supervised and version-controlled by you

---

## ðŸ§± Core Modules (Crates)

Here's the **module plan** we'll follow (aligned with your `Cargo.toml`):

| Crate Name          | Responsibility                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `microkernel`       | Core OS abstractions, runtime control, WASM host       |
| `container-runtime` | Create/run/manage containers                           |
| `network-manager`   | CNI, virtual networks, firewall policies               |
| `storage-manager`   | Volume mounts, layered filesystems, persistent storage |
| `plugin-manager`    | WASM plugins: lifecycle, isolation, sandboxing         |
| `security`          | Zero Trust policies, identity, TLS/mTLS, RBAC          |
| `api`               | gRPC/HTTP control plane APIs (for UI/CLI/etc.)         |
| `cli`               | Terminal-based control commands                        |
| `common`            | Shared types, errors, logging, tracing, config etc.    |

## ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Bootstrapping

### âœ… Step 1: Create the Workspace

```bash
mkdir ForgeOne && cd ForgeOne
cargo new --lib crates/common
```

Then create each module:

```bash
cargo new --lib crates/microkernel
cargo new --lib crates/container-runtime
cargo new --lib crates/network-manager
cargo new --lib crates/storage-manager
cargo new --lib crates/plugin-manager
cargo new --lib crates/security
cargo new --lib crates/api
cargo new --bin crates/cli
```

> You'll have:

```
ForgeOne/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ crates/
    â”œâ”€â”€ common/
    â”œâ”€â”€ microkernel/
    â”œâ”€â”€ container-runtime/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Setup Workspace Root `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "crates/common",
    "crates/microkernel",
    "crates/container-runtime",
    "crates/network-manager",
    "crates/storage-manager",
    "crates/plugin-manager",
    "crates/security",
    "crates/api",
    "crates/cli"
]
```

You can keep additional configs like `[profile]`, `[patch]`, etc., later.

---

### âœ… Step 3: Start with `common` Crate

This will contain:

* Shared `Error`, `Result`, `Config`
* Logging init
* Environment setup

Example `lib.rs`:

```rust
pub mod config;
pub mod error;
pub mod logging;
```

Start small. Just create `Result<T>` and some custom error type with `thiserror`.

---

### âœ… Step 4: Build `microkernel` in Isolation

This will:

* Handle WASM engine bootstrap
* Interface with plugins
* Manage runtime

Only depend on:

```toml
[dependencies]
wasmtime = { version = "9.0.3", optional = true }
wasmer = { version = "3.1.1", optional = true }
anyhow = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"
```

Use `[features]`:

```toml
[features]
default = ["wasmtime-runtime"]
wasmtime-runtime = ["wasmtime"]
wasmer-runtime = ["wasmer"]
```

Export a simple `Kernel::init()` function that logs version and engine.

---

### âœ… Step 5: Slowly Add Others (One-by-One)

* After `microkernel`, move to `container-runtime`

  * Create stubs for container spec, runtime trait, basic CLI interaction
* Then `network-manager` (define a basic interface for veth or bridge)
*
