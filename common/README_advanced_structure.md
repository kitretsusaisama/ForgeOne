# ForgeOne Common Module - Advanced Folder Structure

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive plan for reorganizing the ForgeOne Common module's folder structure to improve maintainability, scalability, and adherence to best practices. The plan is based on the current structure and the database schema information.

## Contents

- [Advanced Folder Structure Plan](advanced_folder_structure_plan.md) - Detailed plan for the new folder structure
- [Migration Script](migration_script.ps1) - PowerShell script to implement the folder structure reorganization
- [Folder Structure Diagram](folder_structure_diagram.svg) - Visual representation of the proposed folder structure
- [Database Schema Diagram](database_schema_diagram.svg) - Visual representation of the database schema

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved Modularity**: Each module is clearly separated into its own directory, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Better Code Organization**: Related code is grouped together, making it easier to find and modify.

3. **Enhanced Testability**: Tests are organized to match the module structure, making it easier to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

4. **Clearer Documentation**: Documentation is organized to match the module structure, making it easier to find information.

5. **Scalability**: The structure can easily accommodate new modules and features as the project grows.

6. **Consistency**: The structure follows Rust best practices for project organization.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Module Reorganization

1. **Create Module Directories**: Create directories for each module in the src directory.
2. **Move Existing Code**: Move existing code into the appropriate module directories.
3. **Create mod.rs Files**: Create mod.rs files for each module to re-export the module's components.
4. **Update Imports**: Update imports in all files to reflect the new structure.

### Phase 2: Test Reorganization

1. **Create Test Directories**: Create directories for unit, integration, and performance tests.
2. **Move Existing Tests**: Move existing tests into the appropriate test directories.
3. **Create Common Test Utilities**: Create common test utilities for fixtures and helpers.
4. **Update Test Imports**: Update imports in all test files to reflect the new structure.

### Phase 3: Data Reorganization

1. **Create Vault Directory**: Create a directory for encrypted secrets.
2. **Create Backups Directory**: Create a directory structure for backups.
3. **Update Data Access Code**: Update code that accesses data to reflect the new structure.

### Phase 4: Documentation

1. **Create Documentation Files**: Create documentation files for each module.
2. **Create Example Documentation**: Create documentation for examples.
3. **Update Main README**: Update the main README to reflect the new structure.

## Migration Script

The [migration_script.ps1](migration_script.ps1) file contains a PowerShell script that automates the implementation of the folder structure reorganization. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Creates the necessary directories for the new structure.
2. Creates mod.rs files for each module.
3. Moves existing files to their new locations.
4. Creates placeholder files for new components.

To run the script, execute the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
./migration_script.ps1
```

## Folder Structure Diagram

The [folder_structure_diagram.svg](folder_structure_diagram.svg) file contains a visual representation of the proposed folder structure. The diagram illustrates the organization of the source code, tests, data, examples, and documentation.

## Database Schema Diagram

The [database_schema_diagram.svg](database_schema_diagram.svg) file contains a visual representation of the database schema. The diagram illustrates the organization of the databases, tables, and their relationships.

## Conclusion

The proposed folder structure provides a solid foundation for the ForgeOne Common module, improving maintainability, scalability, and adherence to best practices. By implementing this structure, the project will be better positioned for future growth and development.
