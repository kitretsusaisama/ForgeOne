ForgeOne common Crate Implementation
I've successfully created the advanced ForgeOne common crate as specified in the requirements. This crate serves as the "Conscious Kernel Substrate" of the ForgeOne platform, providing a trust-aware, AI-augmented, self-adaptive foundation for enterprise container intelligence.

Implemented Components
The crate has been structured according to the module tree outlined in the specifications, with the following key components:

Core Infrastructure

lib.rs: Entry point with module declarations and initialization functions
bootstrap.rs: Trust-aware boot process with logging initialization
prelude.rs: Type-safe, controlled global interface for easy imports
Identity & Trust

identity.rs: Identity context with tenant, user, agent, and device lineage
trust.rs: Zero Trust Policy graph engine for trust evaluation
policy.rs: DSL and runtime policy matcher for access control
Observability & Diagnostics

telemetry.rs: Trace ID and span correlation for metrics and logs
observer.rs: LLM-explainable trace summaries for AI consumption
diagnostics.rs: Self-diagnostic engine for runtime verification
Security & Audit

audit.rs: Immutable audit stream signer for compliance
crypto.rs: Signature, fingerprint, and entropy sealing utilities
error.rs: Diagnostic and audit-traceable error handling
Configuration & Utilities

config.rs: Multi-layer configuration with attestation
macros.rs: Utility macros for logging, tracing, and policy enforcement
Testing

tests/consciousness.rs: Self-diagnosing AI/trace-based test logic
Key Features
The implemented crate provides the following advanced capabilities:

LLM-Traceable Observer: Runtime events are converted into prompt-summarized feedback strings
Cryptographic Provenance: Configurations and identities can be signed and verified
ZTA Policy Graph Engine: Zero Trust Architecture with policy evaluation
Self-Diagnostics: AI-readable status checks for system health
Telemetry Context Surface: Comprehensive logging, tracing, and metrics
Zero-Bloat Boot: Efficient initialization process
Immutable Context: Thread-safe, immutable data structures
Documentation
A comprehensive README.md has been created with usage examples for all major components, making it easy for developers to understand and use the crate.

The crate is now ready for integration with the other ForgeOne modules, particularly the microkernel crate which would be the next logical step in the development process.
