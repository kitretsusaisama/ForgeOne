# ForgeOne Code Style & Quality (MNC-Grade, Production-Ready)

*This guide provides advanced, actionable, MNC-grade, production-ready, and compliance-driven code style and quality practices for ForgeOne. All code contributions, reviews, and evidence are mapped to SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and enterprise SLAs. Audit, evidence, and operational guarantees are integral to every step.*

## 1. Principles & Compliance Mapping
- **Secure, maintainable, and auditable code:** All code must follow secure coding standards and be auditable [SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.14, GDPR Art.32]
- **Consistent formatting:** Use rustfmt, clippy, and other automated tools for all code [SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.14]
- **Comprehensive documentation and comments:** All code must be documented and reviewed for clarity and compliance [SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.14]
- **Operational Guarantees:** All code changes (PR, review, merge, release) are logged, versioned, and exportable for audit and regulatory review.
- **Audit Evidence:** All code reviews, approvals, merges, and test results are logged and available for audit. Quarterly reviews and compliance checks are mandatory.
- **Compliance Hooks:** All code style and quality procedures are reviewed quarterly and after every major incident or regulatory change. Automated compliance checks and alerts are integrated into all code workflows.

## 2. Security & Compliance
- **Follow secure coding standards (OWASP, RustSec):** All code is reviewed for security, compliance, and auditability [SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.14, GDPR Art.32]
- **Automated static analysis and vulnerability scanning:** All code must pass automated security and compliance checks before merge [SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.14]

## 3. Testing & Quality
- **Unit, integration, security, and performance tests required:** All code must be tested for functionality, security, and compliance [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12]
- **85%+ code coverage target:** All code must meet or exceed coverage targets [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12]
- **All tests must pass CI/CD pipeline:** No code is merged without passing all automated tests and compliance checks [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12]
- **Evidence Generation:** All test results, coverage reports, and CI/CD logs are retained for audit and regulatory review.

## 4. Production Best Practices
- All code must be reviewed and approved by at least one security/compliance reviewer.
- All documentation and code comments must be up-to-date and reviewed.
- Integrate with SIEM/SOC for real-time monitoring and compliance reporting.
- Review and update all code style and quality procedures quarterly or after every major incident or regulatory change.
