# ForgeOne Microkernel (Atomic, DMCOA, Production-Ready)

## 1. Atomic Module Reference
- [modules/microkernel-l2.txt]: Core orchestration, WASM runtime, ZTA enforcement
- [modules/common-l1.txt]: Shared types, config, error handling
- [common]: Identity, trust, error, policy, telemetry, diagnostics

## 2. Architecture & Atomic Structure
- **Microkernel**: Minimal, secure, reflexive execution core
- **Subsystems**:
  - Execution Brain: Modular kernel graph, LLM-interpretable
  - ZTA Policy Engine: Dynamic syscall enforcement, trust vector
  - WASM Host: Sandboxed plugin/runtime
  - Observer: OTEL, LLM summaries, forensic replay
  - Crypto: Ed25519/SHA3, .forgepkg validation
  - Diagnostics: Self-test, anomaly detection
  - Interface: API, prelude
  - Config: Immutable, signed runtime config

## 3. DMCOA Alignment
- Distributed, modular, secure, self-healing
- Zero Trust enforcement at syscall and thread level
- Real-time observability, forensic replay, and audit
- Plugin runtime (WASM), hot-patchable policies

## 4. Code Mapping
- See [modules/microkernel-l2.txt] for full module tree and Rust code examples
- Use [common] crate for identity, trust, error, policy, telemetry, diagnostics
- All syscalls, execution traces, and policy checks are auditable and testable

## 5. Compliance & MNC-Grade Readiness
- SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR: All actions logged, signed, and auditable
- Quarantine and self-healing for compromised workloads
- Immutable audit logs, forensic replay, and evidence collection

## 6. Test Strategy
- Unit tests: Syscall enforcement, policy engine, DNA trace
- Integration tests: WASM/plugin execution, quarantine, replay
- Security tests: ZTA bypass attempts, compromised identity, policy hot-patch
- Compliance tests: Audit log integrity, evidence export

## 7. Example Test Cases
- Allow/deny syscalls based on trust vector
- Quarantine on ZTA block
- Validate .forgepkg signature and manifest
- Forensic replay matches original execution
- LLM summary output is correct and complete
