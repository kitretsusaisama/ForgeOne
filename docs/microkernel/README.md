# ForgeOne Microkernel Module Documentation

## Overview
The Microkernel module is the sentient, reflexive, cryptographically sovereign execution brain of ForgeOne, providing a hyper-optimized foundation for secure container execution. This documentation covers all the components of the Microkernel module.

## Core Principles
Every function, type, and trace in the Microkernel module is:
- **Sentient** (self-aware, context-sensitive, and reflexive)
- **Zero-Trust** (enforces policies at syscall, thread, and memory level)
- **Explainable** (LLM-interpretable, auditor-verifiable, AI-observable)
- **Sovereign** (cryptographically secure, tamper-evident, and integrity-enforced)
- **Resilient** (self-healing, fault-tolerant, and predictive)

## Module Documentation

### Core Modules
- [Core](./core.md) - Trust anchor boot logic, runtime orchestration, and smart scheduling
- [Execution](./execution.md) - WASM runtime, plugin execution, and secure syscall entrypoint
- [Trust](./trust.md) - ZTA policy evaluation, syscall enforcement, and quarantine mechanisms
- [Observer](./observer.md) - Trace recording, forensic replay, and memory/state export
- [Crypto](./crypto.md) - Signature verification and .forgepkg validation
- [Diagnostics](./diagnostics.md) - Kernel health tests and anomaly detection
- [Interface](./interface.md) - External API and prelude
- [Config](./config.md) - Enforced configuration graph

## Architecture

### Execution Brain
The Execution Brain is a fully modularized kernel graph where runtime decisions are driven by LLM-interpretable memory-trace correlation. It provides:
- Predictive malicious behavior detection
- Self-explanation to auditors, AI agents, and humans
- Dynamic syscall logic rewriting based on trust vector entropy
- Secure workload launching across diverse environments

### Zero-Trust Policy Engine
The ZTA Policy Engine provides per-syscall, per-thread, and per-memory enforcement with policy tracing and adaptive escalation. Key features include:
- Dynamic policy rewriting based on anomaly heatmaps
- Trust vector evaluation for all syscalls
- Comprehensive policy violation tracking
- Automatic quarantine for compromised processes

### Container Execution DNA
Every container execution maintains a DNA-style hash trace that includes identity, entropy, and outcome information. This provides:
- Complete syscall audit trail
- Integrity scoring
- Risk flagging
- Forensic replay capabilities

## Getting Started

### Initialization
```rust
// Initialize with default configuration
microkernel::init()?;

// Or initialize with custom configuration
microkernel::init_with_config("config.json")?;

// Initialize with specific trust anchor
microkernel::init_with_trust_anchor(anchor)?;
```

### Syscall Execution
```rust
// Execute a syscall with full ZTA enforcement
let result = microkernel::execution::syscall::secure_syscall(
    "open_file",
    &["path/to/file", "r"],
    &identity_context,
    &zta_policy_graph,
    &mut execution_dna
);

// Check result and handle accordingly
match result {
    Ok(_) => println!("Syscall allowed"),
    Err(e) => println!("Syscall denied: {}", e),
}
```

### Container Execution
```rust
// Launch a container with full ZTA enforcement
let container = microkernel::execution::launch_container(
    &container_config,
    &identity_context,
    &zta_policy_graph
)?;

// Monitor container execution
let execution_dna = container.execution_dna();
println!("Container integrity score: {}", execution_dna.integrity_score);
```
