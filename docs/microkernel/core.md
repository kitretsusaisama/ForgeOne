# Microkernel Core Module

*This document is production-ready, MNC-grade, and compliance-focused. All features, processes, and responsibilities are mapped to SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and enterprise SLAs. Security, audit, and evidence generation are integral to every step.*

## Overview
The Core module provides the foundational components for the ForgeOne microkernel, including trust anchor boot logic, runtime orchestration, and smart scheduling. It ensures the integrity and security of the microkernel from boot to runtime, with all actions logged and exportable for audit and compliance.

## Key Features

### Trust Anchor Boot Logic
- **Secure Boot Process**: Validates the integrity of all microkernel components during startup
- **Chain of Trust**: Establishes a cryptographic chain of trust from hardware to application
- **Tamper Detection**: Identifies and prevents boot-time tampering attempts
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Provides fallback options for compromised boot sequences
- **Auditability**: All boot events and integrity checks are logged and exportable for compliance review

### Runtime Orchestration
- **Execution Flow Management**: Coordinates the execution of containers and plugins
- **Resource Allocation**: Intelligently allocates system resources based on priority and trust
- **State Management**: Maintains and secures the state of running containers
- **Lifecycle Control**: Manages the complete lifecycle of containers from creation to termination
- **Auditability**: All runtime events, state changes, and resource allocations are logged and exportable

### Smart Scheduling
- **Identity-Aware Scheduling**: Considers identity context in scheduling decisions
- **Load-Based Optimization**: Balances workloads based on system load and resource availability
- **Geographical Distribution**: Optimizes execution based on geographical constraints
- **Trust-Vector Prioritization**: Prioritizes high-trust workloads during resource contention
- **Auditability**: All scheduling decisions and workload allocations are logged for compliance

## Core Components

### Boot Module
```rust
pub struct BootContext {
    pub trust_anchor: TrustAnchor,
    pub boot_measurements: Vec<Measurement>,
    pub integrity_status: IntegrityStatus,
    pub boot_time: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
}

pub enum IntegrityStatus {
    Verified,
    Compromised(String),
    Unknown,
}

pub struct TrustAnchor {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub public_key: Vec<u8>,
    pub signature: Vec<u8>,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}

pub struct Measurement {
    pub component: String,
    pub hash: String,
    pub expected_hash: String,
    pub timestamp: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    pub status: MeasurementStatus,
}

pub enum MeasurementStatus {
    Valid,
    Invalid,
    NotMeasured,
}
```

### Runtime Module
```rust
pub struct RuntimeContext {
    pub containers: HashMap<Uuid, ContainerContext>,
    pub plugins: HashMap<Uuid, PluginContext>,
    pub resources: ResourceState,
    pub policies: PolicySet,
    pub status: RuntimeStatus,
}

pub enum RuntimeStatus {
    Starting,
    Running,
    Degraded(String),
    Stopping,
    Stopped,
}

pub struct ContainerContext {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub identity: IdentityContext,
    pub execution_dna: ExecutionDNA,
    pub resources: ContainerResources,
    pub status: ContainerStatus,
}

pub enum ContainerStatus {
    Creating,
    Running,
    Paused,
    Quarantined(String),
    Stopping,
    Stopped,
    Failed(String),
}
```

### Scheduler Module
```rust
pub struct SchedulerContext {
    pub workloads: Vec<Workload>,
    pub resources: ResourceState,
    pub policies: PolicySet,
    pub metrics: SchedulerMetrics,
}

pub struct Workload {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub priority: Priority,
    pub identity: IdentityContext,
    pub resource_requirements: ResourceRequirements,
    pub constraints: Vec<Constraint>,
}

pub enum Priority {
    Critical,
    High,
    Normal,
    Low,
    Background,
}

pub struct ResourceState {
    pub cpu: CpuState,
    pub memory: MemoryState,
    pub storage: StorageState,
    pub network: NetworkState,
}

pub struct Constraint {
    pub constraint_type: ConstraintType,
    pub value: String,
}

pub enum ConstraintType {
    Location,
    Hardware,
    Network,
    Affinity,
    AntiAffinity,
    Custom(String),
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Initializing the Boot Process
```rust
use microkernel::core::boot;

// Initialize the boot process with a trust anchor
let trust_anchor = boot::TrustAnchor::from_file("trust_anchor.json")?;
let boot_context = boot::initialize(trust_anchor)?;

// Check boot integrity
if boot_context.integrity_status == boot::IntegrityStatus::Verified {
    println!("Boot process verified successfully");
} else {
    println!("Boot integrity compromised: {:?}", boot_context.integrity_status);
    // Handle compromised boot (log, alert, trigger recovery)
}
```

### Managing Runtime Containers
```rust
use microkernel::core::runtime;

// Get the runtime context
let runtime_ctx = runtime::get_context();

// Launch a new container
let container_config = ContainerConfig::new("my-container");
let container_id = runtime::launch_container(container_config, identity_context)?;

// Get container status
let container = runtime_ctx.containers.get(&container_id).unwrap();
println!("Container status: {:?}", container.status);

// Stop a container
runtime::stop_container(container_id)?;
```

### Scheduling Workloads
```rust
use microkernel::core::scheduler;

// Create a new workload
let workload = scheduler::Workload {
    id: Uuid::new_v4(),
    priority: scheduler::Priority::High,
    identity: identity_context,
    resource_requirements: ResourceRequirements::default(),
    constraints: vec![],
};

// Schedule the workload
let allocation = scheduler::schedule_workload(workload)?;

// Check allocation
println!("Workload scheduled on node: {}", allocation.node_id);
```

## Operational & Compliance Guarantees
- **All boot, runtime, and scheduling actions are logged, versioned, and exportable for audit and regulatory review.**
- **Security Note:** Never embed secrets or credentials in code or configuration. Use environment variables and secure storage only.
- **Error Handling:** All API calls and module functions return detailed error types. All errors are logged and can be exported for audit.
- **Integration:** The core module exposes a stable ABI and API for integration with external systems, plugins, and observability tools.
- **Review:** All procedures and code are reviewed quarterly and after every major incident or regulatory change.

## Troubleshooting
- **Boot Failure:** Ensure trust anchor and boot measurements are valid and signed. Check logs for error details.
- **Runtime Degradation:** Review resource allocation and policy status. All degradations are logged with full context.
- **Scheduling Issues:** Validate workload constraints and resource availability. All scheduling failures are logged and exportable.
- **Audit/Compliance Issues:** Ensure all logs and evidence are retained and accessible for review.
