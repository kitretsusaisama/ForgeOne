# ForgeOne Microkernel Diagrams

This directory contains architectural and structural diagrams for the ForgeOne Quantum-Grade Microkernel. These diagrams provide visual representations of the microkernel's architecture, components, and interactions.

## Available Diagrams

### 1. Microkernel Architecture (`microkernel_architecture.svg`)

This diagram illustrates the overall architecture of the ForgeOne Microkernel, showing the layered design and component interactions. It includes:

- Interface Layer (API, Prelude, External Bindings, Config)
- Core Layer (Boot, Runtime, Scheduler)
- Execution Layer (WASM Host, Plugin Host, Syscall)
- Trust Layer (ZTA Policy, Syscall Enforcer, Redzone)
- Observer Layer (Trace, Forensic, Snapshot)
- Crypto Layer (Signature, ForgePkg)
- Diagnostics Layer (Self-Test, Anomaly)
- Common Module Integration

### 2. Folder Structure (`microkernel_folder_structure.svg`)

This diagram provides a visual representation of the microkernel's folder and file organization, showing:

- Root directory structure
- Source code organization
- Module hierarchy
- Test and benchmark organization

### 3. Syscall Architecture (`syscall_architecture.svg`)

This diagram details the syscall architecture of the microkernel, including:

- Application Layer integration
- Syscall Interface design
- Syscall Bridge implementation
- Syscall Engine categories (Process, Memory, I/O, Security)
- Security Layer integration (ZTA Policy, Syscall Enforcer, Redzone, Audit)
- Telemetry Layer (Syscall Metrics, Performance, Tracing)
- Core Services integration

### 4. Execution Model (`execution_model.svg`)

This diagram illustrates the execution model of the microkernel, showing:

- Execution Environments (WASM, Plugin, Sandbox)
- Execution Engine components
- Scheduler design and implementation
- Trust Layer integration
- Observer Layer monitoring
- Core Integration points

### 5. Trust Architecture (`trust_architecture.svg`)

This diagram details the Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) implementation in the microkernel, including:

- Trust Policy Engine
- Attestation Layer
- Enforcement Layer
- Audit Layer
- Integration Layer
- Trust boundaries and security perimeters

## Updating Diagrams

When updating the microkernel architecture or implementation, please ensure these diagrams are kept in sync with the changes. The diagrams should be updated when:

1. New modules or components are added
2. Existing components are modified or removed
3. Interaction patterns between components change
4. Security boundaries or trust relationships are altered

## Integration with Documentation

These diagrams are referenced in various documentation files:

- Main README.md in the microkernel directory
- Module-specific documentation files
- Implementation guides and architecture documents

## Design Principles

The diagrams follow these design principles:

1. **Clarity**: Each diagram focuses on a specific aspect of the microkernel
2. **Consistency**: Color coding and visual language are consistent across diagrams
3. **Completeness**: All major components and interactions are represented
4. **Accuracy**: Diagrams reflect the actual implementation, not just the design intent
5. **Accessibility**: SVG format ensures scalability and compatibility
