# ForgeOne Syscall Bridge Diagrams

This directory contains architectural and flow diagrams for the ForgeOne Syscall Bridge component. These diagrams provide visual representations of the syscall bridge architecture, flow processes, and security model.

## Available Diagrams

### 1. Syscall Bridge Architecture (`syscall_bridge_architecture.svg`)

This diagram illustrates the layered architecture of the ForgeOne Syscall Bridge, including:

- **Application Layer**: WASM Modules, Native Plugins, Containers, and API interfaces
- **Syscall Bridge Layer**: ABI Translator, Syscall Router, Security Filter, and Tracer
- **Syscall Engine Layer**: Process, Memory, I/O, and Security Syscalls
- **Security Layer**: ZTA Policy, Syscall Enforcer, Redzone, and Audit mechanisms
- **Telemetry Layer**: Performance monitoring and metrics collection

Key features highlighted include Zero-Trust Syscall Validation, Quantum-Grade Security, High-Performance Bridge, and Complete Audit Trail.

### 2. Syscall Flow (`syscall_flow.svg`)

This diagram depicts the flow of syscall operations through the ForgeOne system, including:

- **Request Phase**: Application, Syscall Request, ABI Translator, and Syscall Router
- **Security Phase**: Security Filter, ZTA Policy Check, and Decision points
- **Execution Phase**: Syscall Engine and Syscall Execution
- **Response Phase**: Audit Logger, Syscall Response, and Access Denied paths

The diagram shows both normal and error flow paths through the system.

### 3. Syscall Security Model (`syscall_security_model.svg`)

This diagram illustrates the comprehensive security model implemented in the ForgeOne Syscall Bridge, including:

- **Prevention Layer**: Static Analysis, Capability Model, Sandboxing, and Attestation
- **Detection Layer**: Syscall Monitoring, Behavioral Analysis, Resource Monitoring, and Audit Logging
- **Enforcement Layer**: ZTA Policy Engine, Syscall Filtering, Redzone Protection, and Response Actions
- **Recovery Layer**: Forensic Analysis, State Recovery, Policy Updates, and Incident Response

The diagram highlights the defense-in-depth approach with Zero-Trust Architecture, Quantum-Grade Attestation, and Continuous Monitoring as key features.

## Viewing the Diagrams

These SVG diagrams can be viewed directly in most modern web browsers or SVG-compatible image viewers. For an interactive viewing experience, you can use the included `viewer.html` file in this directory.

## Updating the Diagrams

When updating these diagrams, please maintain the consistent visual style and color scheme. The diagrams should be kept in sync with the actual implementation of the syscall bridge component.

## Documentation Integration

These diagrams are referenced in the ForgeOne documentation and should be kept up-to-date with any architectural changes to the syscall bridge component.

## Design Principles

The diagrams follow these design principles:

1. **Clarity**: Each diagram focuses on a specific aspect of the syscall bridge
2. **Consistency**: Visual language is consistent across all diagrams
3. **Completeness**: All major components and flows are represented
4. **Accuracy**: Diagrams reflect the actual implementation
5. **Accessibility**: SVG format ensures scalability and accessibility
