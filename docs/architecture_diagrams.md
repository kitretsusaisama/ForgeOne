# ForgeOne System Architecture Diagrams

This document provides an overview of the architecture diagrams for the ForgeOne microkernel system, which implements a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for secure computing.

## Available Diagrams

### 1. System Architecture Diagram
*File: [system_architecture.svg](./system_architecture.svg)*

This high-level diagram shows the main modules of the ForgeOne system and their relationships. It illustrates the layered architecture with the Common (Conscious Substrate) layer providing shared services, the Microkernel implementing core functionality, and the Application Layer running on top.

**Key Components:**
- Common Module (Identity, Policy, Error, Telemetry, Crypto, etc.)
- Microkernel Modules (Core, Trust, Execution, Observer, etc.)
- Syscall Bridge (ABI Translator, Syscall Router, Security Filter, etc.)
- Plugin Manager (Registry, Lifecycle, Loader, etc.)
- Application Layer (Container Workloads, WASM Modules)

### 2. Component Interaction Diagram
*File: [component_diagram.svg](./component_diagram.svg)*

This diagram focuses on the interactions between specific components within the system, showing data flows and relationships between individual components rather than just modules.

**Key Features:**
- Detailed component-level view
- Data flow between components
- Trust flow paths
- Syscall flow paths

### 3. Trust Flow Diagram
*File: [trust_flow_diagram.svg](./trust_flow_diagram.svg)*

This data flow diagram specifically illustrates how the Zero Trust Architecture evaluates and enforces security policies throughout the system.

**Key Processes:**
- Syscall request flow
- Trust evaluation process
- Policy enforcement decisions
- Quarantine and redzone operations
- Behavioral analysis feedback loop

### 4. Syscall Sequence Diagram
*File: [syscall_sequence_diagram.svg](./syscall_sequence_diagram.svg)*

This sequence diagram shows the temporal flow of operations during a syscall evaluation, illustrating the interactions between different components over time.

**Key Sequences:**
- Syscall initiation
- Trust evaluation
- Policy enforcement
- Execution (if allowed)
- Observation and recording

### 5. Syscall Bridge Architecture
*File: [syscall-bridge/diagrams/syscall_bridge_architecture.svg](./syscall-bridge/diagrams/syscall_bridge_architecture.svg)*

This diagram illustrates the layered architecture of the ForgeOne Syscall Bridge component, showing how it mediates between applications and system resources.

**Key Components:**
- Application Layer (WASM Modules, Native Plugins, Containers)
- Syscall Bridge Layer (ABI Translator, Syscall Router, Security Filter)
- Syscall Engine Layer (Process, Memory, I/O, Security Syscalls)
- Security Layer (ZTA Policy, Syscall Enforcer, Redzone)

### 6. Syscall Flow
*File: [syscall-bridge/diagrams/syscall_flow.svg](./syscall-bridge/diagrams/syscall_flow.svg)*

This diagram depicts the detailed flow of syscall operations through the ForgeOne system, including security checks and execution paths.

**Key Processes:**
- Syscall request processing
- Security filtering
- ZTA policy evaluation
- Execution or denial paths
- Audit logging

### 7. Syscall Security Model
*File: [syscall-bridge/diagrams/syscall_security_model.svg](./syscall-bridge/diagrams/syscall_security_model.svg)*

This diagram illustrates the comprehensive security model implemented in the ForgeOne Syscall Bridge.

**Key Layers:**
- Prevention Layer (Static Analysis, Capability Model, Sandboxing, Attestation)
- Detection Layer (Syscall Monitoring, Behavioral Analysis, Resource Monitoring)
- Enforcement Layer (ZTA Policy Engine, Syscall Filtering, Redzone Protection)
- Recovery Layer (Forensic Analysis, State Recovery, Incident Response)

### 8. Policy Graph Diagram
*File: [policy_graph_diagram.svg](./policy_graph_diagram.svg)*

This diagram illustrates the structure of the ZTA policy graph, showing how policies are organized and evaluated to make security decisions.

**Key Elements:**
- Policy hierarchy
- Decision nodes
- Condition operators (AND, OR)
- Policy evaluation paths

## Understanding the Architecture

The ForgeOne system implements a Zero Trust Architecture where:

1. **Every syscall is evaluated** against security policies before execution
2. **Identity context** (including trust vectors) is central to all security decisions
3. **Continuous observation** provides feedback to adapt trust decisions based on behavior
4. **Policy enforcement** can result in allowing, warning, quarantining, blocking, or terminating operations
5. **Behavioral analysis** continuously updates the system's understanding of normal vs. suspicious activity

## Key Architectural Principles

- **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust based on network location or asset ownership
- **Contextual**: All decisions consider the full context of the operation
- **Causal**: The system understands cause-effect relationships in execution flows
- **Comprehensible**: The architecture is designed to be understandable and explainable
- **Cryptographic**: Strong cryptographic verification is used throughout
- **Resilient**: The system can detect and respond to anomalies and attacks

## Integration Points

The diagrams collectively show how the system integrates at multiple levels:

- **Module Integration**: How major modules interact (system architecture diagram)
- **Component Integration**: How specific components connect (component interaction diagram)
- **Data Flow Integration**: How information flows through the system (trust flow diagram)
- **Temporal Integration**: How processes unfold over time (sequence diagram)
- **Policy Integration**: How security policies are structured and evaluated (policy graph diagram)

## Using These Diagrams

These diagrams can be used for:

- Understanding the overall system architecture
- Tracing how syscalls are processed and evaluated
- Comprehending the Zero Trust security model implementation
- Identifying key integration points for new components
- Understanding the policy evaluation process
