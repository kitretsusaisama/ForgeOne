# ForgeOne Quantum-Grade HyperContainer Runtime Diagrams

## Overview

This directory contains SVG diagrams that visualize various aspects of the ForgeOne Quantum-Grade HyperContainer Runtime architecture and components. These diagrams are designed to help developers, architects, and other stakeholders understand the structure and functionality of the runtime system.

## Available Diagrams

### 1. Runtime Architecture

**File:** `diagrams/runtime_architecture.svg`

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the runtime architecture, showing the main modules and their relationships. It illustrates how the core runtime components interact with security, execution, network, and storage subsystems.

### 2. Container Lifecycle

**File:** `diagrams/container_lifecycle.svg`

This diagram illustrates the container lifecycle state machine, showing the various states a container can be in (CREATED, RUNNING, PAUSED, STOPPED, EXITED) and the transitions between these states. It also shows the API functions that trigger these transitions.

### 3. Container Creation Process

**File:** `diagrams/container_creation.svg`

This diagram details the step-by-step process of container creation, from generating a container ID to applying configuration. It shows the sequence of operations performed by the `create_container` function in the registry module.

### 4. Configuration Module Structure

**File:** `diagrams/config_module.svg`

This diagram shows the structure of the configuration module, including its submodules (loader, validator, saver, tests) and the relationships between them. It also illustrates the core `ContainerConfig` type and its supporting structures.

### 5. Security Architecture

**File:** `diagrams/security_architecture.svg`

This diagram illustrates the security architecture of the runtime, centered around Zero Trust Architecture. It shows how attestation, cryptography, policy enforcement, and isolation mechanisms work together to provide a secure container execution environment.

### 6. Network Architecture

**File:** `diagrams/network_architecture.svg`

This diagram shows the network architecture of the runtime, including the virtual network bridge, container firewall, and service mesh components. It illustrates how containers communicate with each other and with external networks.

## Usage

These SVG diagrams can be viewed in any modern web browser or SVG-compatible image viewer. They can also be included in documentation, presentations, or other materials to help explain the runtime architecture and functionality.

## Maintenance

These diagrams should be kept up-to-date as the runtime architecture evolves. When making significant changes to the runtime code, consider updating the relevant diagrams to reflect these changes.
