### 3. Module Documentation

**Coming Soon**

In-depth documentation of each module in the runtime, including their purpose, components, and interactions.

### 4. Configuration Guide

**Coming Soon**

A comprehensive guide to configuring the runtime and containers, including all available options and their effects.

### 5. Security Documentation

**Coming Soon**

Detailed information on the runtime's security features, including Zero Trust Architecture, attestation, and cryptography.

## Core Features

The ForgeOne Quantum-Grade HyperContainer Runtime includes the following core features:

- **Modular Execution Engine**: Support for WASM, Native, MicroVM, and future AI agents
- **ZTA-Native Contracts**: Zero Trust Architecture with runtime DNA and trust signatures
- **Secure Image Format**: Enhanced OCI compatibility with ForgePkg and encrypted snapshots
- **Self-Aware Containers**: Introspective lifecycle management
- **Agent Scheduler Compatibility**: Integration with dynamic multi-agent runtime
- **Forensic Tracing**: Complete tracing from spawn to syscall to response
- **Inter-Container RPC**: MessageBus abstraction over async IPC
- **Per-Container Prometheus Metrics**: Isolation-level observability
- **Hot Reloadable**: Controlled rolling runtime reload

## Architecture

The container runtime follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
