# ForgeOne Runtime Diagrams

## Overview

This directory contains SVG diagrams that visualize the architecture and components of the ForgeOne Quantum-Grade HyperContainer Runtime. These diagrams are designed to be both informative and visually appealing, providing clear insights into the runtime's structure and functionality.

## Diagram Files

### 1. `runtime_architecture.svg`

A high-level overview of the runtime architecture, showing the main modules and their relationships. This diagram illustrates the modular design of the runtime and how different components interact with each other.

### 2. `container_lifecycle.svg`

A state machine diagram showing the lifecycle of a container, from creation to termination. This diagram illustrates the various states a container can be in and the transitions between these states.

### 3. `container_creation.svg`

A sequence diagram showing the step-by-step process of container creation. This diagram details the operations performed by the `create_container` function in the registry module.

### 4. `config_module.svg`

A structural diagram showing the organization of the configuration module. This diagram illustrates the submodules, their functions, and the core data structures used for container configuration.

### 5. `security_architecture.svg`

A diagram illustrating the security architecture of the runtime, centered around Zero Trust Architecture. This diagram shows how various security mechanisms work together to provide a secure container execution environment.

### 6. `network_architecture.svg`

A diagram showing the network architecture of the runtime. This diagram illustrates how containers are connected to the host network and to each other, including the virtual network bridge, firewall, and service mesh components.

## Viewing the Diagrams

These diagrams are in SVG format, which can be viewed in any modern web browser or SVG-compatible image viewer. To view a diagram:

1. Open the SVG file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Use the browser's zoom functionality to examine details
3. For printing or inclusion in documents, SVGs can be converted to PNG or PDF formats as needed

## Updating the Diagrams

As the runtime architecture evolves, these diagrams should be updated to reflect changes. When updating a diagram:

1. Maintain the same visual style and color scheme for consistency
2. Ensure that the diagram accurately represents the current architecture
3. Update the corresponding documentation in the main index file

## Design Principles

These diagrams follow these design principles:

- **Clarity**: Each diagram focuses on a specific aspect of the runtime
- **Consistency**: Similar visual language is used across all diagrams
- **Completeness**: All major components and relationships are represented
- **Accessibility**: Color choices consider accessibility needs

## Integration with Documentation

These diagrams are referenced in the main runtime documentation and can be included in other documentation as needed. When referencing a diagram, use the relative path `docs/runtime/diagrams/[filename].svg`.
