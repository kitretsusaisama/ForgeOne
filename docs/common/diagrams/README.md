# ForgeOne Common Module Diagrams

## Overview

This directory contains architectural and design diagrams for the ForgeOne Common Module. These diagrams provide visual representations of the module's structure, components, security architecture, integration patterns, and data flow.

## Diagram Descriptions

### Module Structure Diagram (`module_structure.svg`)

This diagram illustrates the overall structure of the ForgeOne Common Module, categorizing its components into different functional layers:

- **Foundation Layer**: Core utilities and base functionality
- **Security Layer**: Components related to identity, crypto, and policy enforcement
- **Observability Layer**: Audit, telemetry, and diagnostics components
- **Storage Layer**: Database access and persistence components
- **Integration Layer**: Components for interacting with other system modules

The diagram shows the relationships between different modules and their hierarchical organization.

### Database Schema Diagram (`database_schema.svg`)

This diagram visualizes the database schema used by the Common Module, including:

- **System Database**: Core system configuration and state
- **Logs Database**: Audit logs and system events
- **Blobs Database**: Binary large objects and file storage
- **Events Database**: Event streams and notifications

The diagram shows tables, fields, relationships, and the overall database architecture.

### Security Architecture Diagram (`security_architecture.svg`)

This diagram presents the Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) implemented in the Common Module, featuring:

- **Zero Trust Core**: Central policy engine
- **Security Modules**: Identity, Trust, Policy, and Crypto components
- **Security Boundary**: Defined trust boundaries within the system
- **External Systems**: Integration with external security services
- **Security Features**: Key security capabilities provided by the module

The diagram emphasizes the "never trust, always verify" security model implemented throughout the system.

### Integration Patterns Diagram (`integration_patterns.svg`)

This diagram shows how the Common Module integrates with other system components, highlighting:

- **Integration Patterns**: Observer, Dependency Injection, Repository, Adapter, and Factory patterns
- **External Systems**: Runtime, Microkernel, Plugin Manager, Database, API Gateway, and Security Services
- **Bidirectional Flows**: Data and control flows between components

The diagram illustrates the architectural patterns used for system-wide integration.

### Data Flow Architecture Diagram (`data_flow_architecture.svg`)

This diagram depicts the data processing pipeline within the Common Module, including:

- **Data Sources**: External inputs to the system
- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Input validation and normalization
- **Data Processing Layer**: Transformation, validation, enrichment, and encryption
- **Data Storage Layer**: Persistence mechanisms
- **Data Access Layer**: Query, retrieval, and access control
- **Data Consumers**: Components that use the processed data

The diagram shows how data flows through the system, from ingestion to consumption.

## Viewing Instructions

These diagrams are provided in SVG format, which can be viewed in any modern web browser or SVG-compatible image viewer. For the best viewing experience:

1. Open the SVG files in a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
2. Use the browser's zoom functionality to examine details
3. For printing, use the browser's print function with the "Background graphics" option enabled

## Update Guidelines

When updating these diagrams:

1. Maintain consistent visual styling with existing diagrams
2. Ensure all components accurately reflect the current codebase
3. Update the README.md file with descriptions of any new or modified diagrams
4. Preserve the SVG format for all diagrams

## Integration with Documentation

These diagrams are referenced in various documentation files:

- Main documentation: `/docs/README.md`
- Common module documentation: `/docs/common/README.md`
- Architecture overview: `/docs/architecture_diagrams.md`

When updating diagrams, ensure that references in these documents remain accurate.

## Design Principles

These diagrams follow these design principles:

1. **Clarity**: Each diagram focuses on a specific aspect of the architecture
2. **Consistency**: Visual language is consistent across all diagrams
3. **Accuracy**: Diagrams reflect the actual implementation in the codebase
4. **Modularity**: Components are grouped logically to show relationships
5. **Hierarchy**: Different levels of abstraction are represented appropriately
