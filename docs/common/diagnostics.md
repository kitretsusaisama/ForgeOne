# Advanced Diagnostics System

## Overview
The Diagnostics module provides a comprehensive self-diagnostic engine with real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and enterprise-grade observability for containerized workloads.

## Key Features
- Real-time health monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Predictive failure detection using ML-based anomaly detection
- Distributed tracing integration with OpenTelemetry
- Multi-dimensional metrics collection and alerting
- Security posture assessment and compliance checking
- Performance profiling and resource optimization recommendations

## Core Components

### Severity Levels
Diagnostic events are categorized by severity:
- `Critical` - Highest severity, requires immediate attention
- `High` - Serious issues that need prompt attention
- `Medium` - Important issues that should be addressed
- `Low` - Minor issues that can be addressed later
- `Info` - Informational events

### Health Status
System components can have the following health statuses:
- `Healthy` - Component is functioning normally
- `Degraded` - Component is functioning but with reduced performance
- `Unhealthy` - Component is not functioning properly
- `Unknown` - Component status cannot be determined

### Component Types
Different types of system components that can be monitored:
- `Runtime` - Container runtime components
- `Network` - Network-related components
- `Storage` - Storage-related components
- `Security` - Security-related components
- `Scheduler` - Task scheduling components
- `Registry` - Container registry components
- `Metrics` - Metrics collection components
- `Logging` - Logging components
- `Custom` - Custom components

### Metrics
- `MetricPoint` - Data point with timestamp, value, and labels
- `ComponentHealth` - Health information for a component
- `Alert` - Alert information for a component
- `PerformanceMetrics` - Performance metrics for the system

## Usage Example
```rust
// Run system diagnostics
let identity = IdentityContext::root();
let report = diagnostics::run_system_diagnostics(&identity).await?;

// Check system health
if report.overall_health == HealthStatus::Healthy {
    println!("System is healthy");
} else {
    println!("System health issues detected");
    for issue in &report.issues {
        println!("Issue: {}", issue.message);
    }
}
```
