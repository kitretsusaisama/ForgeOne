# Telemetry System

*This document is production-ready, MNC-grade, and compliance-focused. All features, processes, and responsibilities are mapped to SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and enterprise SLAs. Security, audit, and evidence generation are integral to every step.*

## Overview
The Telemetry module provides comprehensive telemetry capabilities for the ForgeOne platform, enabling monitoring, tracing, and performance analysis across the system. All telemetry actions and metrics are logged and exportable for audit and compliance.

## Key Features
- Metrics collection and reporting
- Distributed tracing with span correlation
- Health monitoring and reporting
- Performance profiling
- Resource usage tracking
- Prometheus integration
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Structured logging with context
- **Auditability:** All telemetry events, metrics, and health checks are logged and exportable

## Core Components

### MetricType
Telemetry metric types:
- `Counter` - Counter metrics (only increase)
- `Gauge` - Gauge metrics (can increase or decrease)
- `Histogram` - Histogram metrics (statistical distribution)
- `Summary` - Summary metrics (percentiles)

### MetricValue
Telemetry metric value:
- `Integer` - Integer value
- `Float` - Float value
- `Boolean` - Boolean value
- `String` - String value
- `Histogram` - Histogram values

### Metric
Telemetry metric:
- `name` - Metric name
- `description` - Metric description
- `metric_type` - Metric type
- `value` - Metric value
- `labels` - Metric labels
- `timestamp` - Timestamp

### HealthStatus
Health status:
- `Healthy` - System is healthy
- `Degraded` - System is degraded but operational
- `Unhealthy` - System is unhealthy

### HealthCheckResult
Health check result:
- `component` - Component name
- `status` - Health status
- `details` - Details about the health check
- `timestamp` - Timestamp

### HealthReport
System health report:
- `status` - Overall health status
- `checks` - Individual component health checks
- `timestamp` - Timestamp

## Usage Example
```rust
// Initialize telemetry
telemetry::init_telemetry(None)?;

// Record a metric
let metric = Metric {
    name: "request_count".to_string(),
    description: "Number of requests".to_string(),
    metric_type: MetricType::Counter,
    value: MetricValue::Integer(1),
    labels: HashMap::new(),
    timestamp: Utc::now(),
};
telemetry::record_metric(&metric)?;

// Get health report
let health_report = telemetry::get_health_report()?;
println!("System health: {:?}", health_report.status);
```

## Operational & Compliance Guarantees
- **All telemetry events, metrics, and health checks are logged, versioned, and exportable for audit and regulatory review.**
- **Security Note:** Never embed secrets or credentials in code or configuration. Use environment variables and secure storage only.
- **Error Handling:** All API calls and module functions return detailed error types. All errors are logged and can be exported for audit.
- **Integration:** The telemetry module exposes a stable ABI and API for integration with external systems, plugins, and observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, OpenTelemetry).
- **Review:** All procedures and code are reviewed quarterly and after every major incident or regulatory change.

## Troubleshooting
- **Metric Recording Failure:** Ensure metric types and values are valid. Check logs for error details.
- **Health Check Failure:** Validate component status and health check configuration. All failures are logged with full context.
- **Audit/Compliance Issues:** Ensure all logs and evidence are retained and accessible for review.
