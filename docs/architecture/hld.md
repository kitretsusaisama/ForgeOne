# High-Level System Architecture (HLA)

*This document details the ForgeOne architecture for MNC-grade, production-ready deployments, with explicit mapping to enterprise compliance, operational, and business requirements.*

## 1. System Overview

ForgeOne is a next-gen, production-grade containerization platform for ultra-secure, high-performance, and developer-friendly infrastructure at MNC scale. The architecture is based on the Distributed Microservices Container Orchestration Architecture (DMCOA) pattern, featuring a Rust-based microkernel, modular plugin system, and zero-trust security by default. All design choices are validated against SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and enterprise SLAs.
