# Security Threat Modeling

*ForgeOne's threat model is engineered for end users, production environments, and compliance. Every risk and mitigation is mapped to real-world user protection, regulatory requirements, and operational auditability.*

## 1. Introduction (User & Compliance Focus)

This document details the security threat model for ForgeOne, covering all modules (microkernel, plugins, daemon, runtime, network, auth, vault, db, forgefile, observability, dsm, ui, apiserver, etc.) in a Zero Trust, modular, MNC-scale architecture. STRIDE methodology is used for systematic risk analysis, with all findings traceable to user and compliance impact.

## 2. System Overview (Production-Ready)

ForgeOne is a modular, microkernel-based containerization platform with:
- Zero Trust security (mTLS, RBAC, MFA, audit)—user and compliance protection
- Plugin system (sandboxed, signed, versioned)—user safety and auditability
- Distributed, self-healing, multi-tenant design—user reliability
- ACID-compliant, encrypted storage (Redb)—user data integrity and compliance
- Full observability and compliance (SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR)—audit and regulatory assurance

## 3. STRIDE Threat Model (by Module, User & Compliance)

### Spoofing
- API credential theft (API server, plugins)
- Container/image impersonation (runtime, registry)
- Network identity spoofing (network, service mesh)
- User identity theft (auth, UI)
- Plugin impersonation (plugin manager)

**Mitigations:** mTLS, MFA, short-lived tokens, signed images/plugins, audit logs—user and compliance safety

### Tampering
- Image/config tampering (runtime, db, forgefile)
- Network traffic modification (network, VPN)
- Plugin code modification (plugins)
- Storage data tampering (db, vault)

**Mitigations:** Signing, integrity checks, encryption, RBAC, audit—user data and compliance protection

### Repudiation
- Denial of actions (API, runtime, plugins)
- Unauthorized access denial (auth, vault)
- Configuration change denial (all modules)

**Mitigations:** Immutable, tamper-evident audit logs, signed change history—user and regulatory traceability

### Information Disclosure
- Sensitive data in logs (all modules)
- Data leakage (runtime, db, vault)
- Network sniffing (network, VPN)

**Mitigations:** Log sanitization, encryption at rest/in transit, strict isolation—user and compliance assurance

### Denial of Service
- Resource exhaustion (runtime, network, db)
- Network partitioning (network, service mesh)
- Plugin/worker crash (daemon, plugins, dsm)

**Mitigations:** Resource quotas, circuit breakers, self-healing, autoscaling—user reliability and audit

### Elevation of Privilege
- Privilege escalation (runtime, plugins, daemon)
- Unauthorized plugin execution (plugin manager)
- Bypass of RBAC/ABAC (auth, apiserver)

**Mitigations:** Least privilege, sandboxing, policy enforcement, audit—user and compliance safety

## 4. Compliance & Security Controls (Production-Ready)
- SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, CIS Benchmarks—user and regulatory assurance
- Automated compliance checks, evidence collection—audit and traceability
- Regular security reviews, penetration testing, red team—real-world risk reduction

## 5. Security Testing (User & Audit)
- Penetration, fuzzing, SAST/DAST, continuous scanning—user and compliance safety
- Pre-release, quarterly, and continuous testing—production-grade

## 6. Security Roadmap (User, Compliance, Future-Proof)
- Short-term: Full STRIDE coverage, audit, mTLS, RBAC, MFA
- Medium-term: Advanced anomaly detection, automated compliance
- Long-term: AI-driven threat detection, quantum security
