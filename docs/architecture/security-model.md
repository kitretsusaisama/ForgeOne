# Security Model

*This document provides a deeply detailed, MNC-grade, production-ready security model for ForgeOne. Every security control is mapped to compliance (SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR) and operational requirements, with actionable, auditable, and future-proof practices.*

## 1. Zero Trust Security Architecture (User, Compliance, Operations)

ForgeOne enforces a comprehensive Zero Trust security model: "never trust, always verify." All communications are authenticated, authorized, and encrypted, with continuous monitoring and audit. Security is embedded at every layer, from microkernel to plugins, supporting MNC-grade compliance (SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR) and real-world user protection.

### 1.1 Core Principles & Compliance Mapping

|---------------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| No Implicit Trust     | All components/users/services must authenticate & authorize       | SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.9, GDPR Art.32 |
| Least Privilege       | RBAC/ABAC, minimal permissions by default                        | SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.9, GDPR Art.25 |
| Micro-Segmentation    | Namespace/network isolation, per-tenant boundaries               | ISO 27001 A.13, GDPR Art.32        |
| Continuous Verification| MFA, mTLS, policy checks for all access                         | SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.9, GDPR Art.32 |
| Continuous Monitoring | Real-time anomaly detection, immutable audit logs                | SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12, GDPR Art.33|

- **Centralized, structured event collection:** For SIEM/SOC, mapped to SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12.
- **Automated compliance reporting:** SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR.

## 3. Secrets Management (Key Rotation, Injection, Audit)
- **Redb-backed encrypted vault:** All secrets are encrypted at rest (SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.10, GDPR Art.32).
- **Dynamic secrets, auto-rotation, secure injection:** All secret access is logged and auditable (SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.10).
- **Audit logging for all secret access:** Evidence for SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR.
- **Key management:** Automated rotation, backup, and restore, with evidence for audits.

## 4. Threat Detection & Response
- **Behavioral and signature-based anomaly detection:** Real-time monitoring of containers, plugins, and network (SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12).
- **Runtime monitoring:** All actions are logged, with automated alerting and response (SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12).
- **Automated remediation and incident response playbooks:** Predefined playbooks for common threats (SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.16).
- **Forensic tools for post-incident analysis:** All evidence is collected, versioned, and exportable for regulatory review (GDPR Art.33, ISO 27001 A.16).
- **Evidence collection:** Immutable logs, incident reports, and audit trails for every event.

## 5. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- **Threat modeling (STRIDE):** All new features undergo threat modeling (SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.14).
- **Secure coding, code reviews:** All code is reviewed for security and compliance (SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.14).
- **Static/dynamic analysis (SAST/DAST):** Automated scans for vulnerabilities (SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12).
- **Red team exercises, continuous vulnerability scanning:** Regular pen-testing and red teaming (SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.18).
- **Continuous monitoring:** All code, infra, and runtime are monitored for new threats (SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12).
