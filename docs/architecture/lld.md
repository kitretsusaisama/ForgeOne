# Low-Level Design (LLD)

*This document provides a deeply detailed, MNC-grade, production-ready low-level design for ForgeOne. Every component, interface, and integration is built for security, traceability, compliance, and operational excellence.*

## 1. Component Specifications (User, Security, Compliance)

## 4. Failure Scenarios & Recovery
- Node, network, storage, or component failure triggers auto-recovery, alerting, and forensic logging.
