# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

*This PRD is advanced, actionable, MNC-grade, production-ready, and compliance-driven. All requirements, features, and processes are mapped to SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and enterprise SLAs. Every module and feature includes operational guarantees, audit evidence, and compliance hooks. All content is actionable, non-assumptive, and tailored to ForgeOne.*

## 1. Vision & Problem Statement

ForgeOne is a next-generation, production-grade containerization platform reimagining Docker/Podman for the enterprise. It delivers ultra-secure, high-performance, developer-friendly infrastructure for MNC-scale collaboration (1000+ developers), with a static, minimal, cross-platform (Rust-based) core, ACID-compliant hyper-compressed storage, self-healing, and distributed fault tolerance. The platform is modular, extensible, and ready for 2026+ competition. All features and processes are mapped to compliance and operational requirements.

## 4. Architecture Pattern

**Pattern:** Distributed Microservices Container Orchestration Architecture (DMCOA)
- Microkernel core (daemon/runtime), plugin system (extensible, event-driven), zero-trust by default (auth at every step), snapshot/delta-aware (Redb, observability, dsm), self-healing, distributed, scalable. All architecture decisions are mapped to compliance and operational requirements.

## 5. Goals & Objectives (with Traceability)

- Daemonless, rootless, OCI-compliant runtime [SOC2, ISO 27001]
- WebAssembly-based microkernel for isolation/portability [SOC2, ISO 27001]
- Zero Trust security (mTLS, RBAC, MFA, audit) [SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR]
- Multi-tenant, namespace isolation, 1000+ devs [SOC2, ISO 27001]
- Delta-level stress testing, self-healing, rollback [SOC2, ISO 27001]
