# ForgeOne Plugin System Diagrams

This directory contains SVG diagrams that illustrate various aspects of the ForgeOne Plugin System architecture and functionality.

## Available Diagrams

### 1. Plugin Manager Architecture (`plugin_manager_architecture.svg`)

This diagram illustrates the layered architecture of the ForgeOne Plugin Manager, including:

- Plugin Interface layer for ABI, extension points, manifest, and API
- Plugin Manager Core with registry, lifecycle, loader, and manager components
- Runtime Layer showing WASM plugin support and execution engines
- Security Layer with attestation, verification, sandbox, and namespace components
- Syscall Layer for microkernel integration
- Metrics Layer for performance monitoring and telemetry

### 2. Plugin Lifecycle (`plugin_lifecycle.svg`)

This diagram shows the complete lifecycle of plugins within the ForgeOne system:

- Discovery Phase: How plugins are found and initially processed
- Activation Phase: Validation, registration, and initialization steps
- Runtime Phase: Execution, pausing, updating, and unregistration processes
- Termination Phase: Proper shutdown and cleanup procedures
- Error flows and recovery paths

### 3. Plugin Sandbox Architecture (`plugin_sandbox_architecture.svg`)

This diagram details the secure sandbox environment for plugin execution:

- Host Application and Plugin Manager integration
- Sandbox Environment with isolated plugin instances
- Memory space, resource limits, and syscall interface for each plugin
- Security boundary with memory isolation, syscall filtering, resource limiting, and attestation
- Communication paths between host and plugins, and between plugins

### 4. Plugin Extension Points (`plugin_extension_points.svg`)

This diagram maps out the extension point system that allows plugins to extend ForgeOne functionality:

- Core Application components that provide extension capabilities
- Extension Points Layer that manages and coordinates extensions
- Categorized extension points for UI, Data, Security, Runtime, Integration, and Telemetry
- Plugin Registry for extension registration and discovery

### 5. Plugin Integration Architecture (`plugin_integration.svg`)

This diagram shows how plugins integrate with the ForgeOne platform and external systems:

- ForgeOne Core Platform components
- Plugin Manager with registry, lifecycle manager, extension registry, and dependency resolver
- Integration Layer for connecting plugins to the platform
- Plugin Types including WASM, Native, and Remote plugins
- External Systems integration paths

## Design Principles

The diagrams follow these design principles:

1. **Clarity**: Each diagram focuses on a specific aspect of the plugin system
2. **Consistency**: Common visual language across all diagrams
3. **Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage of the plugin system architecture
4. **Accuracy**: Faithful representation of the actual implementation
5. **Maintainability**: Structured for easy updates as the system evolves
