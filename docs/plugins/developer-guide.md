# ForgeOne Plugin Developer Guide (Atomic Plugin-Manager, DMCOA, MNC-Grade)

*This guide provides advanced, actionable, MNC-grade, production-ready, and compliance-driven instructions for ForgeOne plugin development. All procedures are mapped to SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and enterprise SLAs. Audit, security, and evidence generation are integral to every step.*

## 1. Atomic Module Reference
- [modules/plugin-manager-l3.txt]: Plugin lifecycle, hooks, security

## 2. Plugin Architecture & Compliance
- WASM-based, ABI-mapped, sandboxed (see plugin-manager-l3.txt)
- Hot-swappable, versioned, signed for production deployment [SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.9, GDPR Art.32]
- Secure hooks for external providers (cloud, storage, auth, observability), all RBAC/ABAC enforced and audited [SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.9]
- All plugin lifecycle events (install, upgrade, remove, failure) are logged, versioned, and exportable for audit [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12, GDPR Art.30]

## 3. Development & Lifecycle (Production Best Practices)
- Target WASM32-unknown-unknown for all plugins
- Export required ABI functions (see plugin-manager-l3.txt)
- Sign plugin for production deployment; unsigned plugins are rejected in production [SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.9]
- Install/update/remove via CLI/API or plugins/ directory; all actions are logged and auditable
- Test all plugins in staging before production deployment; validate for compliance and operational impact
- Review and update plugins quarterly or after every major incident or regulatory change

## 4. Security, Audit, & Evidence Generation
- Plugins run in sandboxed WASM VM; all actions are RBAC/ABAC enforced and logged [SOC2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.9, GDPR Art.32]
- All plugin actions (calls, failures, upgrades) are logged, versioned, and exportable for audit [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12, GDPR Art.30]
- Plugin signature events, sandbox enforcement, and lifecycle changes are available for audit and regulatory review
- Automated compliance reporting and evidence generation for SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and enterprise audits

## 5. Compliance & Operational Guarantees
- All plugin management and development procedures are reviewed quarterly and after every major incident or regulatory change [SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR]
- Immutable logs, plugin signature events, install/upgrade/remove events, and sandbox enforcement are available for audit and regulatory review
- Integrate with SIEM/SOC for real-time monitoring and compliance reporting
