# ForgeOne Agile Epics & Features (End-User, Production-Ready)

*ForgeOne is a next-generation, production-grade containerization platform engineered for end users—enterprise dev teams, DevOps, SREs, and individual developers. Every epic and feature is designed to deliver secure, scalable, and seamless experiences, prioritizing usability, compliance, and real-world reliability.*

## 1. Enterprise Agile Principles (User-Centric)
- Scalable agile (SAFe, LeSS) for 1000+ devs, with workflows tailored for end-user productivity
- Cross-team collaboration, clear ownership, and shared goals, ensuring user needs drive delivery
- Continuous integration, delivery, and feedback loops for rapid, user-validated improvements
- Security, compliance, and audit built into every workflow, protecting user data and trust

## 2. Key Epics (End-User Value)
- **Core Runtime**: Daemonless, rootless, WASM/runc, multi-tenant—empowering users with secure, high-performance environments
- **Security & Compliance**: Zero Trust, RBAC, MFA, audit, SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR—ensuring user safety and regulatory confidence
- **Observability**: Metrics, logs, tracing, real-time dashboards—transparent, actionable insights for users
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: WASM plugins, SDKs, provider integrations—user-driven extensibility and customization
- **Self-Healing/DSM**: Automated rollback, anomaly detection, auto-remediation—minimizing user disruption
- **Multi-Cluster/Region**: Federation, failover, disaster recovery—uninterrupted user experience at scale
- **Developer Experience**: CLI, GUI, Forgefile, GitOps, docs—intuitive, accessible tools for all user types

## 3. Feature Examples (User Impact)

- Plugin hot-swap, versioning, sandboxing—user empowerment and safety
- Real-time health checks, alerting, and auto-scaling—proactive user support
- Multi-cloud, hybrid, and on-prem support—user flexibility and choice

## 4. Agile Best Practices (Production-Ready)
- Definition of Done includes security, compliance, documentation, and user validation
- Automated testing (unit, integration, security, performance) for robust user experiences
- Regular retrospectives and continuous improvement, with user feedback as a core input
- Traceability from epics to features to tests, ensuring user needs are met at every stage
