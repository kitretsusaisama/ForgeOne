# ForgeOne Agile Planning (Production-Ready, End-User Focus)

*Agile planning in ForgeOne is a rigorous, data-driven, and compliance-integrated process. All planning is traceable, auditable, and focused on delivering measurable value to end users in production environments.*

## 1. Planning Philosophy
- **User Value First:** All plans are driven by real user needs, production data, and compliance requirements.
- **Production-Readiness:** Every plan includes security, compliance, monitoring, and rollback from the start.
- **Traceability:** Every decision, story, and task is linked to a user need, compliance goal, or production incident.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Planning adapts based on retrospectives, audits, and user feedback.

## 2. Planning Process (Step-by-Step)
1. **Vision & Roadmap Alignment**
   - Align planning with product vision, roadmap, and regulatory requirements.
   - Review upcoming milestones, compliance deadlines, and production goals.
2. **Backlog Creation & Refinement**
   - Collect user stories, technical debt, compliance tasks, and production incidents.
   - Refine backlog with clear acceptance criteria, security, and compliance requirements.
3. **Prioritization**
   - Use data (user feedback, incident logs, audit findings) to prioritize backlog.
   - Balance user value, risk, and compliance needs.
4. **Capacity & Dependency Planning**
   - Assess team capacity, skillsets, and cross-team dependencies.
   - Ensure all dependencies (infra, access, compliance) are identified and scheduled.
5. **Sprint/Release Planning**
   - Select stories/tasks for the next sprint/release based on capacity and production-readiness.
   - Define clear goals, owners, and production-readiness criteria for each item.
6. **Production-Readiness Integration**
   - For every planned item, define security, compliance, monitoring, documentation, and rollback requirements.
   - Validate that all preconditions (infra, secrets, access) are in place before work begins.
7. **Documentation & Traceability**
   - Document all plans, decisions, and dependencies in an auditable, versioned system.
   - Link every item to user needs, compliance requirements, or production incidents.
8. **Review & Adaptation**
   - Regularly review plans against actual outcomes, user feedback, and audit results.
   - Adapt future planning based on lessons learned and continuous improvement.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Product Owner:** Defines vision, prioritizes backlog, ensures user value and compliance.
- **Scrum Master/Facilitator:** Guides process, enforces production-readiness, removes blockers.
- **Dev Team:** Estimates, commits, and delivers to production-ready standards.
- **Security/Compliance Lead:** Reviews all plans for regulatory and audit compliance.
- **SRE/DevOps:** Ensures infrastructure, monitoring, and rollback are production-grade.

## 4. Integration with Compliance & Security
- All planning artifacts are logged and auditable (SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR).
- Security and compliance are part of acceptance criteria for every planned item.
- Automated evidence collection for audits (plans, reviews, decisions).

## 5. Real-World Example
- **Incident:** Production outage due to expired certificate.
- **Planning Response:** Add recurring task for cert monitoring, update runbooks, schedule pen-test.
- **Traceability:** Link task to incident report and compliance requirement.
- **Outcome:** Outage risk reduced, audit evidence collected.

## 6. Traceability & Audit
- Every plan, story, and decision is linked to a user need, compliance goal, or production incident.
- All planning changes are versioned and auditable.
- Planning effectiveness is measured by user KPIs, incident reduction, and audit pass rate.

## 7. Production-Readiness
- Security: All planned work includes security review and compliance checks.
- Monitoring: Metrics, logs, and alerts are planned and validated.
- Documentation: User and technical docs are updated as part of planning.
- Rollback: Automated rollback plans are included for all major changes.
- Compliance: Evidence is collected and stored for audit.

## 8. Continuous Improvement
- Planning is reviewed and adapted after every sprint, release, and major incident.
- Lessons learned from retrospectives and audits are integrated into future planning.
- User feedback and production data drive ongoing improvement.
