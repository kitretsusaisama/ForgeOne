# ForgeOne Agile Sprints (End-User, Production-Ready)

*Sprint planning and execution in ForgeOne are rigorous, auditable, and focused on delivering measurable value to end users. Every sprint is structured for security, compliance, and production reliability, with traceability from planning to delivery.*

## 1. Sprint Planning & Execution (Step-by-Step)
1. **Backlog Refinement**
   - Review and prioritize user stories, bugs, and technical debt with input from users, compliance, and production data.
   - Ensure all items have clear acceptance criteria, security, and compliance requirements.
2. **Sprint Planning Meeting**
   - Define sprint goal focused on user value and production impact.
   - Select stories/tasks that can be completed to production-ready standards.
   - Assign owners and clarify dependencies.
3. **Task Breakdown & Estimation**
   - Break stories into actionable tasks (dev, test, security, documentation).
   - Estimate effort and validate capacity.
4. **Production-Readiness Checks**
   - For each story/task, define production-readiness criteria (security, compliance, monitoring, documentation, rollback plan).
   - Validate that all dependencies (infra, secrets, access) are in place.
5. **Sprint Execution**
   - Daily standups to track progress, blockers, and production risks.
   - Continuous integration, automated testing, and code review for every change.
   - Security and compliance checks before merge/deploy.
6. **Demo & User Validation**
   - Demo completed work to users/stakeholders.
   - Collect feedback and validate against acceptance criteria and production-readiness.
7. **Sprint Review & Close**
   - Review sprint goal achievement, production incidents, and compliance outcomes.
   - Document lessons learned and improvement actions for next sprint.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Product Owner:** Prioritizes backlog, defines user value, validates deliverables.
- **Scrum Master/Facilitator:** Ensures process discipline, removes blockers, enforces production-readiness.
- **Dev Team:** Delivers features, fixes, and documentation to production-ready standards.
- **Security/Compliance Lead:** Reviews all changes for regulatory and audit compliance.
- **SRE/DevOps:** Ensures deployment, monitoring, and rollback are production-grade.

## 3. Integration with Compliance & Security
- All sprint artifacts (stories, tasks, reviews) are logged and auditable.
- Security and compliance are part of Definition of Done for every task.
- Automated evidence collection for audits (test results, code reviews, deployment logs).

## 4. Real-World Example
- **Story:** Add MFA to user login.
- **Tasks:** Implement backend logic, update UI, write tests, update docs, validate compliance.
- **Production-Readiness:** Pen-test new flow, add monitoring, document rollback.
- **Demo:** Show working MFA to users, collect feedback.
- **Audit:** Store test results, code review, and deployment logs for compliance.

## 5. Traceability & Audit
- Every story/task is linked to a user need, compliance requirement, or production incident.
- All changes are traceable from planning to deployment and audit.
- Sprint effectiveness is measured by user KPIs, incident reduction, and audit pass rate.

## 6. Production-Readiness Checks
- Security: All code reviewed, pen-tested, and compliant.
- Monitoring: Metrics, logs, and alerts in place.
- Documentation: User and technical docs updated.
- Rollback: Automated rollback plan tested.
- Compliance: Evidence collected and stored for audit.
