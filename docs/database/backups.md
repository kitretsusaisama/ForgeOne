# ForgeOne Backups (Redb, Atomic Storage-Manager, DMCOA)

*This document provides advanced, MNC-grade, production-ready, and compliance-focused backup and disaster recovery (DR) documentation for ForgeOne. All procedures are mapped to SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and enterprise audit requirements.*

## 1. Atomic Module Reference
- [modules/storage-manager-l6.txt]: Backup/restore logic, DR, snapshotting
- [modules/common-l1.txt]: Config, error handling

## 2. Backup & Restore Flows
- **Automated, scheduled backups:** All Redb, Vault, and config data is backed up on a configurable schedule. [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12]
- **Sharded, cross-region, encrypted backup storage:** Backups are sharded, stored in multiple regions, and encrypted (AES-GCM, Zstd). [GDPR Art.32, ISO 27001 A.10]
- **Restore operations:** All restores are versioned, validated, and audit-logged. [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12]
- **Disaster Recovery (DR):** Quarterly DR drills, cross-region failover, and restore validation. [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.17]
- **Snapshot DNA verification:** All snapshots are validated with DNA-hash for integrity. [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12]
- **Immutable, auditable backup logs:** Every backup and restore event is logged, signed, and exportable for audit. [SOC2 CC7, ISO 27001 A.12, GDPR Art.30]

## 3. Evidence Collection & Audit Trail
- **Backup/restore event logs:** All events are versioned, immutable, and exportable for audit and regulatory review.
- **Access logs:** All backup/restore access is logged and auditable.
- **DR drill evidence:** Results of DR drills and restore validations are retained for audit.
- **Automated compliance reporting:** Evidence packages are generated for SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and enterprise audits.

## 4. Testing & Validation Requirements
- **Backup integrity:** Automated tests for backup completeness, encryption, and integrity.
- **Restore validation:** All restores are tested in staging before production. Quarterly DR drills are mandatory.
- **Evidence retention:** All test and validation results are retained for audit.

## 5. CLI/DevOps Best Practices
- Use `forge backup create --all` for full, auditable backups.
- Use `forge backup restore --target=logs_shard_0.redb` for targeted, versioned restores.
- Use `forge snapshot create --db=system.redb` for atomic, DNA-validated snapshots.
- Schedule regular, automated backups and DR drills. Validate all restores.
- Monitor and audit all backup/restore events and access.
- Integrate with SIEM/SOC for real-time monitoring and compliance reporting.
