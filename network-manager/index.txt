# Quantum-Network Fabric Layer

## Overview

The Quantum-Network Fabric Layer is a Zero Trust Network Manager for container networking. It provides a secure, scalable, and flexible networking solution for containerized applications with the following features:

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: All network connections are authenticated, authorized, and encrypted by default.
- **Container Networking Interface (CNI)**: Integration with container runtimes like Docker, Kubernetes, and containerd.
- **Virtual Networks**: Create isolated virtual networks for containers with custom CIDR ranges and gateways.
- **Network Policies**: Define fine-grained network policies for container-to-container communication.
- **API**: REST and gRPC APIs for managing networks, containers, and policies.
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics for monitoring network performance and security events.

## Architecture

The Quantum-Network Fabric Layer follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Virtual Network Manager**: Creates and manages virtual networks for containers.
- **CNI Module**: Implements the Container Networking Interface (CNI) specification.
- **API Module**: Provides REST and gRPC interfaces for managing networks and containers.
- **Firewall Module**: Implements Zero Trust network policies and security rules.
- **Bridge Module**: Manages network bridges and virtual Ethernet (veth) pairs.
- **DNS Module**: Provides DNS resolution and service discovery.
- **NAT Module**: Implements Network Address Translation for container connectivity.
- **Mesh Module**: Provides mesh networking capabilities for distributed environments.
- **Metrics Module**: Collects and exports metrics for monitoring and observability. Includes a Prometheus-compatible metrics exporter and periodic metrics collection.
