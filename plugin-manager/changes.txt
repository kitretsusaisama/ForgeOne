content: # ForgeOne Plugin Manager

A secure, production-ready plugin system with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) enforcement for the ForgeOne platform.

## Features

- **Military-grade ZTA**: Every plugin operation is verified against cryptographic identity and policy.
- **Production-scale modularity**: Designed for enterprise environments with 1000+ developers.
- **File-level clarity**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Optimization readiness**: Performance metrics collected at every level.
- **Secure ABI bridge**: Sandboxed communication between host and plugins.
- **Plugin attestation**: Cryptographic verification of plugin integrity.
- **Secure syscall bus**: Policy-enforced system calls with audit logging.

## Architecture

The Plugin Manager consists of the following core components:

- **ABI**: Application Binary Interface for host-plugin communication
- **Attestation**: Plugin signature and hash verification
- **Loader**: Plugin package loading and extraction
- **Runtime**: WebAssembly execution environment
- **Sandbox**: Resource limits and capability restrictions
- **Syscall**: Secure system call interface
- **Lifecycle**: Plugin initialization, starting, stopping, and unloading
- **Metrics**: Performance monitoring and telemetry
- **Plugin**: Plugin instance and manifest management
- **Registry**: Plugin registration and discovery

## Usage

### Loading a Plugin

```rust
use plugin_manager::registry::PluginRegistry;
use common::identity::Identity;

// Create a plugin registry
let mut registry = PluginRegistry::new();

// Create an identity for verification
let identity = Identity::new("plugin-manager");

// Load a plugin from a file
let plugin_id = registry.load_plugin_from_file("/path/to/plugin.forgepkg", identity)?;

// Initialize the plugin
registry.initialize_plugin(plugin_id)?;

// Start the plugin
registry.start_plugin(plugin_id)?;
```

### Creating a Plugin

Plugins are WebAssembly modules that export the following functions:

- `init()`: Called when the plugin is initialized
- `start()`: Called when the plugin is started
- `stop()`: Called when the plugin is stopped
- `pause()`: Called when the plugin is paused
- `resume()`: Called when the plugin is resumed
- `unload()`: Called when the plugin is unloaded

See the [sample plugin](examples/sample-plugin) for an example.

## Plugin Package Format

Plugins are packaged as `.forgepkg` files, which are tar.gz archives containing:

- `manifest.json`: Plugin metadata and permissions
- `plugin.wasm`: WebAssembly module
- Other supporting files

## Security

The Plugin Manager enforces security at multiple levels:

1. **Package verification**: Plugins are verified against their manifest hash and signature
2. **Sandboxing**: Plugins run in a sandboxed environment with resource limits
3. **Capability-based security**: Plugins must declare permissions in their manifest
4. **Syscall enforcement**: All system calls are verified against policy
5. **Audit logging**: All plugin operations are logged for compliance

Now I'll create a main.rs file in the examples directory to demonstrate how to use the plugin manager.

    tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber)?;

    // Initialize the plugin manager
    plugin_manager::init()?;

    // Create a plugin registry
    let mut registry = PluginRegistry::new();

    // Create an identity for verification
    let identity = Identity::new("plugin-manager-example");

    // Get the path to the sample plugin
    let plugin_path = get_sample_plugin_path()?;

    registry.stop_plugin(plugin_id)?;
    info!("Stopped plugin");

    // Unload the plugin
    registry.unload_plugin(plugin_id)?;

    Ok(())

    Ok(path)

    if !wasmtime_enabled && !wasmer_enabled {
        println!(

# ForgeOne Plugin Manager Implementation

I've successfully implemented a secure, production-ready plugin system with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) enforcement for the ForgeOne platform. The plugin manager provides a comprehensive framework for loading, verifying, and executing WebAssembly-based plugins in a sandboxed environment.

## Key Components Implemented

   - Implemented plugin state management and lifecycle
   - Built a registry for plugin discovery and management

2. **Security Features**
   - Implemented cryptographic verification of plugin packages
   - Created a sandboxed execution environment with resource limits
   - Added capability-based security with permission enforcement
   - Built a secure syscall interface with policy enforcement

3. **Runtime Environment**
   - Implemented support for both Wasmtime and Wasmer runtimes
   - Created a unified API for WebAssembly module loading and execution
   - Added ABI functions for host-plugin communication

4. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Implemented plugin initialization, starting, stopping, and unloading
   - Added state transitions with proper validation
   - Created metrics collection for performance monitoring

5. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Added comprehensive README with usage instructions
   - Created a sample plugin to demonstrate the API
   - Added an example application showing how to use the plugin manager

## Integration with ForgeOne

The plugin manager integrates seamlessly with the existing ForgeOne components:

- Leverages the microkernel's execution environment for sandboxing
- Follows the same security model with Zero Trust Architecture

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, you might want to:

1. Implement more comprehensive testing
2. Add support for plugin dependencies and versioning
3. Enhance the syscall interface with more functionality
4. Implement a plugin marketplace for discovery and distribution

The plugin manager is now ready for integration into the ForgeOne platform, providing a secure and scalable way to extend functionality through plugins.
